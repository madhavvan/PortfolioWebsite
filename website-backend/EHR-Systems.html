    <h1>Design, Implementation, and Evaluation of EHR</h1>
    <h2>Transforming Healthcare Through Effective EHR Systems</h2>
    <p>
        The design, implementation, and evaluation of Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems are 
        critical steps in advancing healthcare delivery. A well-designed EHR should prioritize 
        user-friendliness, interoperability, and compliance with health data standards like HL7 and LOINC. 
        During implementation, stakeholder engagement and robust training ensure smooth adoption. Evaluation 
        metrics such as clinical outcomes, patient satisfaction, and system usability determine the success 
        of EHR integration. Leveraging data analytics and periodic reviews, EHR systems can evolve to meet 
        the dynamic needs of healthcare providers and patients, enhancing care coordination and decision-making.
